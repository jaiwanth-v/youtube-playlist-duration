# youtube-playlist-duration
This is a chrome extension which calculates and displays total duration of a YouTube playlist. 

# Features

This extension works with any number of videos.

Added a feature for the user to set the index of starting and ending video.

If the number of videos in a playlist are more than 100, just scroll down to get complete duration.(As youtube renders only 100 videos for the first time page loads.)
